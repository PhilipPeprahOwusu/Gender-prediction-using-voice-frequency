  <h1>Gender Prediction through Voice Analysis</h1>

  <p>In this project, I focused on developing machine learning models to predict gender based on voice analysis. My goal was to train models that could accurately determine whether a voice sample belonged to a male or female speaker.</p>

  <p>I started by exploring a labeled dataset containing various voice features extracted from voice samples. The dataset provided valuable insights into the characteristics that could potentially differentiate between male and female voices.</p>

  <p>After loading and preprocessing the dataset, I split it into training and testing sets. This allowed me to train the models on the training data and evaluate their performance on unseen data.</p>

  <p>I trained two different models: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Random Forest Classifier. The SVM model used the Support Vector Classifier from the scikit-learn library, while the Random Forest model utilized the Random Forest Classifier.</p>

  <p>To assess the models' accuracy, I evaluated their performance on both the training and testing sets. This allowed me to gauge how well the models generalized to unseen data and provided insights into their predictive capabilities.</p>

  <p>In the end, the trained models demonstrated promising results in gender prediction through voice analysis. The accuracy scores indicated that the models were effective in distinguishing between male and female voices based on the provided features.</p>

  <p>To facilitate future use, I saved the trained Random Forest Classifier model using the pickle module.</p>
